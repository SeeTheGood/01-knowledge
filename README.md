CLUE Game Logic

This repository contains a Python implementation of the logic for the classic CLUE game.
The code utilizes logical symbols to represent characters, rooms, and weapons, and checks the knowledge base to determine possible solutions.

The 'termcolor' library is used to print the results in color for better visualization.
The script includes initial knowledge about the game state and adds known and unknown cards to the knowledge base.
To run the code, simply execute the clue.py script in a Python environment with the required dependencies installed.
